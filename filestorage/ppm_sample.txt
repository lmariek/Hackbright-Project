II. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

KXTER FUND ONE LLC (the “Fund), is a Delaware limited liability company. The Fund’s
investment objective is to seek to earn longiterm riskiadjusted returns that are attractive as compared
to those of traditional public equity and Internet based blind investment pools (hereinafter referred to
as “Cruwdfunding Sites”).

The Fund intends to pursue its investment objective by investing its assets, directly or indirectly, in
high quality emerging companies alongside the world’s leading venture capital ﬁrms, angel investor
networks and accelerators. Speciﬁcally the Fund expects to make investments in predominantly early
and venture stages, as well as select seed investments in consumer Internet, software, artificial
intelligence, automation & instrumentation, consumer products, energy, media, food & beverage,
health care/life sciences, financial technology, internet related, telecommunications, other segments
and emerging technologies with high growth opportunity and may also consider investing in other
ventures where the business proposition is compelling. The Fund expects to invest directly, indirectly
via special purpose vehicles formed to invest in a single company (“SPVs”), through or alongside
existing venture capital firms, angel investor networks, accelerators and crowdfunding sites. The Fund
will maintain a specific geographic focus on companies based in the United States, with a focus on
California and the larger San Francisco Bay Area. The Fund seeks to finance exceptional startups
while creating true lasting relationships with our founders and entrepreneurs.

(umnzmsz } 3

The Fund’s approach focuses on taking early stage risk right alongside company founders and
entrepreneurs, helping them build businesses that will last and grow for years to come. This approach
will be coupled with a diversiﬁcation investment model, satisfying the large demand for seed stage
capital by entrepreneurs, whilst protecting early stage investor money and providing uniquely qualified
deal ﬂow to our members. The Fund plans to target direct investments in companies as well as indirect
investments through SPVs and other investment vehicles that present signiﬁcant market opportunities
for our investors.

The Fund is seeking total capital commitments of approximately $25 million to finance a portfolio of
highly capital efficient businesses over a five to ten year period, filling the largely unaddressed niche
within the venture capital industry 7 the seed and Series A stage sector. The goal of the Fund is to
address inefficiencies at this seed stage of the private equity financing continuum, helping fund,
develop and grow successful and sustainable companies from the earliest stages of company formation,
through fundable mid and late stage company maturities, and onto successful liquidation events.

The Fund’s management team possesses a strong track record in starting and exiting startups, corporate
finance, venture capital as well as mentoring seed stage companies. The deal ﬂow, experience, venture
capital contacts and strategic relationships that flow from this track record offer the Fund and its
investors a unique opportunity to identify unique business opportunities in a crowded market of high
demand for capital by entrepreneurs, and low supply of available and sophisticated seed stage capital
by institutions.

The members of the Fund’s management team, through investing capital of their own W have
previously invested in or have been founders of seven startup opportunities, all from the seed stage
level of company formation. Six of these companies were acquired in successful M&A transactions
and one provided liquidity to its investors via an initial public offering. Prior to their sale, all had
achieved successful upfrounds of funding and were cashiﬂow positive and/or revenue generating
enterprises. The Fund’s ambitions are rooted in the more than 20+ years of finance, industry and
entrepreneurial experience of the management team.

III. A NEW MODEL: THE CROWDFUNDED VENTURE FUND

Given the inherent disadvantages of making investments on the Internet, in particular high risk venture
investments on crowdfunding sites, the Fund’s goal is to assist in hedging risk for our investors but
also to provide diversification over multiple sources and platforms. In particular the Fund will seek to
take advantage of strategic relationships that allow for access to investment opportunities that may not
be readily available to an individual investor with limited access and means.

Speciﬁcally, in addition to providing capital investment, the Fund’s principals and advisors are
prepared to lend their expertise and network resources to ensure that the basic building blocks are in
place so each ofthe Fund’s portfolio companies (each, a “Portfolio Company”) can build its business,
making these Portfolio Companies more attractive investments to venture capitalists and more ‘VC
compliant’ and also more able to stand on their own sooner than if they were selflfunded or funded

(omnzmsa } 4

through a crowdfunding platform. Moreover, because the Fund’s principals, associates and advisors
can spend far more time with our entrepreneurs on both pre and post funding business issues, there is
the opportunity to know and understand our founders, their needs and goals and company objectives
at a level that is much deeper than many other blind pool funds being offered on the Internet. This
deep exposure, intimate knowledge and consistent visibility inside a startup investment is a
fundamental and key differentiator between the Fund’s approach and all others 7 and has already
helped the Fund and its management team develop a brand and reputation as a trusted source of capital
and strategic advice for early stage entrepreneurs.

IV. MARKET OPPORTUNITY

As crowdfunding websites, focused mostly on prerseed funding, commit increasing amounts of capital
to new ventures, and venture capital firms further retreat to later stage rounds, the demand for goitor
market funding (also known as Series Seed or Series A rounds) is expected to grow as well,
dramatically increasing the funding gap. The Fund intends to fill a portion of this funding gap by
making investments in companies at this early goitoimarket stage of development, as well as select
seed stage opportunities. By being independent from existing crowdfunding sites and accelerators we
maintain the freedom to select the most promising investments from all relevant platforms, networks,
angel and accelerator groups as well as portfolios of leading venture capital firms.

Our management approach and expertise in nurturing companies through this funding gap should yield
an exceptional amount of deal flow for goitoimarket opportunities. Moreover, the opportunity created
by matching mentored, funded and maturing early stage companies with later stage VCs willing to
place their capital in followron financings, should allow a sophisticated ‘fccder fund’ to help serve the
needs of a venture capital industry still largely overcapitalized with excess mid and later stage funds.

V. INVESTMENT STRATEGY
Diversification

The Manager anticipates that approximately eighty percent (80%) of the Fund’s investment capital will
be invested in Series Seed / Series A stage opportunities alongside or in syndication with existing
venture capital funds (the “Venture Investments”); and approximately twenty percent (20%) of the
Fund’s investment capital will be invested in seed stage opportunities, primarily alongside or with
angel and accelerator funds based in California (the “Innovation Investments”).

For Venture Investments, we assume that the involvement of a third party venture capital firm will
have mitigated a reasonable portion of the risks and milestones associated with this type of investment.
There would still be significant technology and execution risk and we expect to understand these
remaining risks well. Also at this stage, commercial market performance parameters will be defined
to provide a relatively clear understanding of what remains in terms of commercial product
development. Like any venture investment, there may still be gaps in the complete picture and business

(000720452; 5

plan, but clear identiﬁcation of the key success variables and missing pieces should have been
completed with specific market traction (whether users or revenues) having been accomplished.

For Innovation Investments, which include angel, accelerator and incubator funds, we are looking for
entrepreneurs that can identify new ideas that may have a significant chance of succeeding, coupled
with good teams that can execute. We do not expect complete plans, but the key technology risks and
economic and market beneﬁts must have been identified. We want to see the possibility of significant
risk elimination at the lowest possible cost.

Mana ement ualit' .

 

The Fund will seek opportunities in which a strong management team is in place to guide development
of thc core technology and the organization nccdcd to realize the company’s markct potcntial. Factors
that we believe define a strong management team include but are not limited to, the level of education
and/or industry insight and knowledge of the founders, leadership capabilities of the senior
management team, historical ability to reach milestones, problem solve on the fly, coupled with an
ability to maintain cost control.

Technolo ualities

If the opportunity requires a new or innovative core technolog)’, it must offer substantial and
sustainable differentiation and should have defensible intellectual property protection. It is expected
that a company’s underlying technology will have been validated and working product prototypes will
be under development or in a beta stage.

Due Diligence

Ultimatcly, the Fund’s goal is to support thosc companies that have the ability to successfully grow to
cash flow positive and/or where follow on investors are attracted to provide the significant additional
capital needed for full market commercialization at significant incremental valuations.

The Fund will endeavor to apply a focused approach to evaluating companies and SPVs with a more
rigorous due diligence processes than an individual investor on a crowdfunding site could hope to
achieve. Moreover, our management team with entrepreneurial, academic, business and technical
backgrounds and experience will cut across many sectors, and bring valuable insight into the strength
of the underlying technologies and management of the companies we consider for investment, resulting
in greater visibility into company operations, board representation, comprehensive term sheet
negotiations and qualified funding agreements, while participating in a pool of reserved capital to allow
for followron funding opportunities. Additional connections to mid to later stage VCs means that early
stage investors can also reduce their risk that early stage investments might be depleted of cash prior
to followron rounds of funding.

Staged Investments

(omnzmsm 6

Our experience tells us that most entrepreneurs do better with smaller successive rounds of followion
capital, forcing company management to learn cash conservation, prove product Viability, execute
product pivots before major expenditures, or to conduct a fast failure with the least amount of capital
losses. The Fund’s goal is to maintain available followron funding through additional capital reserves
to help protect the Fund’s equity position in future VC rounds, while offering entrepreneurs extra
runway to further expand their business models prior to followion rounds of financing.

Venture Industry Relationships

Market trends indicate that VCs are more and more looking to deploy larger amounts of capital per
round while still seeking to reduce earliest stage risk within their investment portfolios. Because of
this VCs are facing an increasingly competitive market for deal ﬂow, and are, more than ever before,
seeking maturing startups with clean capital structures, talented and financially responsible
management teams, validated technologies, and business models that have an increasingly shorter time
horizon to exit opportunities.

The Fund has established relationships with managing partners of several top tier VCs. We believe
these VCs will refer the Fund deals that are too early for their own funding parameters, and that they
Will also serve as future funding sources for the Fund’s maturing portfolio. This community of VCs is
also expected to play an important role in the Fund’s due diligence process by helping to create specific
milestones for our entrepreneurs to reach given defined expectations for what they might choose to
fund, and at what level of company maturity, going forward.

VI. MANAGEMENT TEAM

The Fund’s management team is comprised of both experienced principals and sophisticated advisors
and associates who contribute to all elements of startup funding and, more importantly, to developing

and threatened litigation involving the Fund. If the expenses of the Fund
(including, without limitation, any expenses related to indemnification
obligations of the Fund or litigation or threatened litigation) exceed the cash
expense reserves of the Fund (as reasonably determined by the Manager),
the Manager or its affiliate may pay such expenses on behalf of the Fund
and seek reimbursement from the Fund, and the Manager shall be permitted
to (i) offset distributions (including in kind distributions) to be made to the
Members on a pro rata basis and recover any such unreimbursed expenses,
or (ii) sell securities held by the Fund and apply the proceeds towards the
payment of such expenses.

The Fund may not incur any indebtedness other than to pay expenses or
shortiterm borrowings to fund Members’ capital contributions on an
expedited basis, or in connection with a remedy provided in the Fund
Agreement related to a Defaulting Member. If a Member’s capital
contributions are “bridged” by such shortiterm borrowings, the Members
whose capital contributions were so “bridged" shall be responsible for the
costs of such borrowings.

The Manager may distribute cash, securities or other Fund assets from time
to time in its sole discretion to the Members in proportion to their capital
commitments.

Income, expense, gain and loss of the Fund will generally be allocated to
the Members in a manner consistent with the priority of distribution set
forth above.

The Manager may determine in its discretion to cause the Fund to advance
tax distributions to Members who have been allocated taxable income
amounts.

The Manager may, in its sole discretion, provide select Members with co,

Capital commitments generally will be drawn down as necessary to fund
investments and to meet Fund expenses and obligations. The Manager
shall have sole discretion as to the amount and timing of such drawdowns,
including without limitation the discretion to call for any portion, or the
entire portion, of the balance of a Member’s capital commitment. Except
in connection with a Fund closing, which may involve an immediate
drawdown of the capital commitment of a Member participating in such
closing, a minimum of ten business days’ notice for capital calls (a
“Drawdown Notice") will be given by the Manager.

Any Member that fails to contribute the full amount specified in a
Drawdown Notice within ten business days of the speciﬁed due date or any
other payment required to be made by it to the Manager or the Fund may
be deemed a defaulting member (a “Defaulting Member") at the discretion
of the Manager. The Manager in its sole discretion may waive or permit the
cure of the condition causing such default subject to such conditions upon
which the Manager and such Member may agree. A Defaulting Member
will be subject to all available remedies the Manager or Fund may pursue
at law or in equity as well as specific remedies provided in the Fund
Agreement.

All proposed transfers of Fund interests will be subject to the consent of the
Manager, which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole discretion
of the Manager. The Fund interests will be subject to restrictions on
transfer designed to satisfy applicable securities and tax law considerations.
Proposed transferees of Fund interests will be required, among other things,
to demonstrate sufficient financial wherewithal to meet remaining capital
commitment obligations. Voluntary withdrawal by Members from the
Fund will generally not be permitted. In certain circumstances described
in the Fund Agreement, a Member may be removed by the Manager.

Upon termination, the Fund’s affairs shall be Wound up and the assets of
the Fund shall be distributed in in the following order of priority:

(i) First, to the creditors of the Fund (other than the Members) in
satisfaction of the liabilities of the Fund, in the order of priority established
by law, either by payment or the reasonable provision for payment thereof;

(ii) Second, to the Members, in repayment of any loans made to, or other
debts owed by, the Fund; and

(iii) Third, to the Members in respect of the positive balances in their

The Manager is only required to devote such time to the Fund’s affairs as
it determines to be necessary in its reasonablejudgment. The Manager may
organize or be associated with other investment funds with objectives
similar to those of the Fund with no duty to account to the Fund or the
Members and without regard to whether the interests of such investment
funds conflict with those of the Fund. The Manager shall not be obligated
to disclose or refer to the Fund any particular investment opportunity,
whether or not such opportunity is of a character which could be undertaken
by the Fund. The Fund may own investments in companies in which the
Manager or an affiliate owns an interest, and the Members will be required
to waive any conflicts of interest that may exist by Virtue of thereof. The
Fund will have no interest in, and the Management Fee will not be offset
by, any directors’ fccs, advisory fees, transaction fees, commitment fees,
investment banking fees, broken deal or breakup fees, or other similar fees
received by the Manager or its affiliates.

The Manager may be removed for Cause upon the Vote of at least 75% in
interest ofthc Members. “Cause" shall mean either (i) all Principals have
permanently ceased performing services for the Manager or (ii) any
Principal performs any act that constitutes a fraud or the commission of a
felony relating to the Manager’s role as the manager of the Fund or
involving moral turpitude, gross negligence or willful breach of duty.

The Manager on its own behalf or on behalf of the Fund, without the
approval of any Member or any other person, may enter into a side letter or
similar agreement to or with a Member which has the effect of establishing

rights under, or altering or supplementing the terms of, the Fund Agreement
or such Member’s subscription agreement.

Except in certain limited cases, the Manager and certain of its affiliates and
agents will not be liable for any act or omission concerning the Fund and
will be indemnified from any expense, damage or injury suffered or
sustained by reason of their potential or actual involvement in the affairs of
the Fund, including as an officer or director ofa company in which the Fund
makes an investment.

The Fund expects to be treated as a partnership for US. federal income tax
purposes. The Manager intends to operate the Fund in a manner such that
it will not be engaged in a trade or business for US. tax purposes.

ERISA Cansiderations Investment in the Fund generally is open to sophisticated institutional
investors, including pension and other funds subject to the United States
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA"). Investors subject to ERISA will be required to make certain
customary representations or provide assurances in order that the Manager
may determine compliance with ERISA’s provisions. The Fund may be
managed in a manner intended to qualify it for the venture capital operating
company exception from the ERISA plan asset rules. Alternatively, the
Manager may decide to limit the aggregate capital commitments of
investors subject to ERISA to less than 25% of the Fund’s total committed
capital.

Reports The Manager will provide the Members with annual audited financial
statements of the Fund within 120 days after the end of the fiscal year of
the Fund and quarterly unaudited financial statements within 90 days after
the end of each fiscal quarter (except the last). Financial statements will be
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. The ﬁscal year end of the Fund will be December 31.

Amendment In general, the Fund Agreement may only be amended by the Manager and
a majority in interest of the Members.

Risk Factors An investment in the Fund involves significant risks and should be
considered only by sophisticated investors able to meet drawdown
obligations and assume the risks of loss and illiquidity inherent with an
investment in the Fund.

VIII. RISK FACTORS

Investors should be aware that an investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk. There can be
no assurance that the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved, or that an investor will receive
any return of its invested capital. In addition, there will be occasions when the Manager (or its
affiliates) encounter potential conﬂicts of interest in connection with the Fund. The following
considerations, among others, should be carefully evaluated before making an investment in the Fund.

Risk Inherent in Venture Capital Investments. The investments intended to be made by the Fund
involve a high degree of risk. In general, financial and operating risks confronting both early, and
developmentalistage companies, as well as more mature expansionistage companies, are significant.
Many emerging growth companies go out of businesses every year. It is difficult to know how
companies will grow, if at all, or what changes may occur in the market. While targeted retums should
reﬂect the perceived level of risk in any investment situation, there can be no assurance that the Fund
will be adequately compensated for risks taken. The loss of art investor’s entire investment in the Fund

((nwzmsm 15

is possible. The timing of profit realization is highly uncertain. Losses are likely to occur early in the
Fund’s term, while successes often require a long maturation.

Earlyistage and developmentalistage companies often experience unexpected problems in the areas of
product development, manufacturing, marketing, financing and general management, which, in some
cases, cannot be adequately solved. Such companies may require substantial amounts of financing
which may not be available through institutional private placements or the public markets. In addition,
the markets that such companies target are highly competitive and in many cases the competition
consists of larger companies with access to greater resources. The percentage of such companies that
survive and prosper is small.

Investments in more mature companies in the expansion or proﬁtable stage involve substantial risks.
Such companies typically have obtained capital in the form of debt and/or equity to expand rapidly,
reorganize operations, acquire other businesses, or develop new products and markets. These activities
by definition involve a significant amount of change in a company and could give rise to significant
problems in sales, manufacturing, and general management of these activities.

Lack of Portfolio Company Information. The information made available to the Fund regarding the
Portfolio Companies the Fund will invest in, either directly or indirectly, is often very limited. As the
Portfolio Companies are privately held, they are not subject to the same disclosure and reporting
obligations of publicly traded companies. The Fund may not be provided with financial, operational,
or other information that may be important in making an investment decision. In many cases, a
Portfolio Company’s valuation at the time of the Fund’s investment and/or the Fund’s ownership
percentage in such Portfolio Company will not be known and such ownership percentage can be
reduced significantly for a number of reasons.

Lack of Information for Monitoring and Valuing the Fund’s Assets. Despite the Manager’s efforts
to acquire sufﬁcient information to monitor the Fund’s investments and make welliinformed valuation
and pricing determinations, the Manager may only be able to obtain limited information at certain
times and, in some cases, may not be able to obtain information beyond the information that is publicly
available. It is possible that the Manager may not be aware on a timely basis of material adverse
changes that have occurred with respect to certain of the Fund’s investments. The Value of the Fund’s
assets could be significantly negatively affected by any such event. Further, the Manager may have to
make Valuation determinations without the benefit of an adequate amount of relevant information.
Investors should be aware that as a result of these difficulties, as well as other uncertainties, any
valuation made by the Manager may not represent the fair market Value of the securities acquired by
the Fund.

Investment in Companies Dependent Upon New Technological Development and Market
Adoption. An investment in the Fund may be susceptible to greater risk than an investment in a fund
that invests in a broader range of securities. The specific risks faced by emerging growth technology
companies such as some of the anticipated Portfolio Companies include:

o rapidly changing science, business models, technologies and consumer preferences;

((nwzmsm 16

0 new competing products or services and improvements in existing products or services which
may quickly render existing products or technologies obsolete;

0 exposure, in certain circumstances, to a high degree of government regulation, making these
companies susceptible to changes in government policy and failures to secure, or unanticipated
delays in securing, regulatory approvals;

o scarcity of management, technical, scientific, research and marketing personnel with
appropriate training;

0 the possibility of lawsuits related to patents and intellectual property; and

o rapidly changing investor sentiments and preferences with regard to technology related
investments (which are generally perceived as risky).

No Assurance of Returns. The Fund will typically be an equity investor in the Portfolio Companies.
The Fund will generally not receive any returns on its investments unless and until a Portfolio Company
distributes money. A private company typically distributes money when it is sold to another company
or a new set of investors, when it pays a dividend, or when it is listed on a stock exchange or other
public trading platform. A Portfolio Company may take a long time to, or may never, achieve one of
these events. As such, there can be no assurance that investors in the Fund will receive any returns
from the Fund. The timing of profit realization, if any, is highly uncertain.

Economic and Market Conditions. The success of any investment activity is determined to some
degree by general economic conditions. The availability, unavailability, or hindered operation of
external credit markets, equity markets and other economic systems which the Fund may depend upon
to achieve its objectives may have a signiﬁcant negative impact on the Fund’s operations and
profitability. The stability and sustainability of growth in global economies may be impacted by
terrorism or acts of war. There can be no assurance that such markets and economic systems will be
available or will be available as anticipated or needed for the Fund to operate successfully. Changing
economic conditions could potentially adversely impact the valuation of portfolio holdings.

Minority Investments. The Fund’s investments may represent minority stakes in privately held
companies. As is the ease with minority holdings in general, such minority stakes that the Fund may
hold will have neither the control characteristics of majority stakes nor the valuation premiums
accorded majority or controlling stakes. The Fund may also invest in companies for which the Fund
has no right to appoint a director or otherwise exert significant inﬂuence. In such cases, the Fund will
be reliant on the existing management and board of directors of such companies, which may include
representatives of other financial investors with whom the Fund is not affiliated and whose interests
may conflict with the interests of the Fund.

(000720452; 17

Reliance on Manager. The Manager will have sole discretion over the investment of the capital
committed to the Fund as well as the ultimate realization of any profits. Investors in the Fund will not
receive the detailed financial information issued by Portfolio Companies that will be available to the
Fund. Accordingly, investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate the relevant economic, financial
and other information that will be utilized by the Manager in its selection of investment terms. As
such, the pool of capital in the Fund represents a blind pool of capital. Investors will be relying on the
Manager to identify, structure, and implement investments consistent with the Fund’s investment
objectives and policies and to conduct the business of the Fund as contemplated by its Fund Agreement.
The loss of one or more of the principals of the Manager would likely have a significant adverse impact
on the business of the Fund. No assurances can be given that the principals of the Manager will
continue to be affiliated with the Fund throughout its term. Notwithstanding any prior experience that
the principals of the Manager may have in making investments of the type expected to be made by the
Fund, any such experience necessarily was obtained under different market conditions and with
different technologies at the forefront of development. There can be no assurance that the principals
of the Manager will be able to duplicate any previous levels of success.

Competitive Marketplace. The marketplace for venture capital investing has become increasingly
competitive. Participation by financial intermediaries has increased, substantial amounts of funds have
been dedicated to making investments in the private sector and the competition for investment
opportunities is at high levels. Some of the Fund’s potential competitors may have greater ﬁnancial
and personnel resources than the Fund. There can be no assurances that the Manager will secure
attractive investment terms for the Fund. To the extent that the Fund encounters competition for
investments, returns to Fund investors may vary.

No Assurance of Additional Capital for Investments. After the Fund has invested in a Portfolio
Company, continued development and marketing of products may require that additional financing be
provided to the Portfolio Company. The Fund expects the Portfolio Companies will have substantial
capital needs that will be need to be funded over several stages of investment. No assurance can be
made that such additional financing will be available and no assurance can be made as to the terms
upon which such financing may be obtained.

Reserves. The Manager may establish reserves for followion investments by the Fund in Portfolio
Companies, operating expenses, Fund liabilities, and other matters. Estimating the appropriate amount
of such reserves is difficult, especially for followion investment opportunities which are directly tied
to the success and capital needs of Portfolio Companies. Inadequate or excessive reserves could impair
the investment returns to the Fund. If reserves are inadequate, the Fund may be unable to take
advantage of attractive followion or other investment opportunities or to protect its existing
investments from dilutive or other punitive terms associated with “payitoiplay” or similar provisions.
If reserves are excessive, the Fund may decline attractive investment opportunities or hold unnecessary
amounts of capital in money market or similar lowiyield accounts.

((uwzmsm 18

Indemniﬁcation. The Fund will be required to indemnify the Manager and certain of its owners,
principals and affiliates for liabilities incurred in connection with the affairs of the Fund. Such
liabilities may be material and have an adverse effect on the retums to Fund investors.

Future and Past Performance. The performance of any prior fund or any personal investments
affiliated with any of the principals of the Manager is not necessarily indicative of the future results
that will be realized by the Fund. While the Manager may intend for the Fund to make investments
that have estimated retums commensurate with the risks undertaken, there can be no assurance that
targeted results will be achieved. Loss of principal is possible on any given investment.

Bridge Financing. The Fund may lend to Portfolio Companies on a shortitenn, unsecured basis in
anticipation of a future issuance of equity or longitenn debt. Such bridge loans would typically be
convertible into a more permanent, longiterm security; however, for reasons not always in the Fund’s
control, such longiterm securities may not issue and such bridge loans may remain outstanding. In
such event, the interest rate on such loans may not adequately reflect the risk associated with the
unsecured position taken by the Fund.

Limitations on Ability to Exit Investments. The Fund will generally endeavor to exit from its
investments in two principal ways: (i) a private sale (including an acquisition of a Portfolio Company)
and (ii) initial and/or secondary public offerings. At any particular time, one or both of these avenues
may not be open to the Fund, or timing with respect to these exit mechanisms may be inopportune. As
such, the ability to exit from and liquidate the Fund’s portfolio holdings may be constrained at any
particular time.

Contingent Liabilities on Disposition of Investments. In connection with the disposition of an
investment in the Portfolio Companies, the Fund may be required to make representations about the
business and financial affairs of such companies typical of those made in connection with the sale ofa
business. The Fund may be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that
any such representations are inaccurate. These arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent
liabilities for which the Manager may establish reserves and escrows. In that regard, distributions may
be delayed or withheld until such reserve is no longer needed or the escrow period expires.

Absence of Liquidity and Public Markets. The Fund’s investments will generally be private, illiquid
holdings. As such, there will be no public markets for the securities held by the Fund and no readily
available liquidity mechanism at any particular time for any of the investments held by the Fund. In
addition, the realization of value from any investments will not be possible or known with any certainty
until the Manager elects, in its sole discretion, to sell the Fund’s investments and subsequently
distribute the proceeds to its investors or to distribute securities to the Fund investors in lieu of cash.

No Market; Illiquidity of Interests. An investment in the Fund will be illiquid and involves a high
degree of risk. Because the Interests will not be registered under the Securities Act there will be no
public market for the Interests, and it is not expected that a public market will develop. An investor in
the Fund may not be able to avail itself of the provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act with respect
to a proposed transfer of its Interest, and the investor will not be permitted to sell its Interest unless

((uwzmsm 19

such interests are subsequently registered under the Securities Act or an exemption from registration
is available. Consequently, investors will bear the economic risks of its investment for the term of the
Fund.

Certain Limitations on the Ability of Investors to Transfer Fund Interests. The transferability of
Interests will be restricted by the Fund Agreement and by United States federal and state securities
laws. In general, a Fund investor will not be able to sell or transfer its Interest to third parties without
the consent of the Manager.

Legal and Regulatory Risks. The Fund will not be registered as an “investment company" under the
Companies Act pursuant to an exemption set forth in Section 3(c)(l) and/or Section 3(c)(7) of the
Companies Act. There is no assurance that such exemptions will continue to be available to the Fund.
Due to the burdens ofcompliancc with the Companies Act, the performance of the Fund’s investment
portfolio could be materially adversely affected, and risks involved in financing the Portfolio
Companies could substantially increase, if the Fund becomes subject to registration under the
Companies Act. Neither the Fund nor its legal counsel can assure the Fund’s investors that, under
certain conditions, changed circumstances, or changes in the law, the Fund will not become subject to
the Companies Act or other burdensome regulation. In addition, the Manager is not registered as an
“investment adviser" under the Advisers Act. The rules promulgated by the SEC under the Doddi
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act") may require the
Manager (or an affiliate of the Manager) to register under the Advisers Act at some point in the future.
In such event, such Manager or affiliate would become subject to additional regulatory and compliance
requirements associated with the DoddiFrank Act or the Advisers Act. Any such additional
requirements, or any different requirements, may be costly and/or burdensome to such party or parties
and could result in the imposition of restrictions and limitations on the operations of the Fund and/or
the disclosure ofinformation to regulatory authorities regarding the operations of the Fund. In addition,
the Fund does not plan to register the offering of the Interests under the Securities Act. As a result, a
Fund investor will not be afforded the protections of the Securities Act with respect to its investment
in the Fund.

Conﬂicts of Interest. The following discussion enumerates certain potential conflicts of interest that
should be carefully evaluated before making an investment in the Fund. The following is not intended
as an exhaustive list of the potential conﬂicts. Instances may arise where the interest of the Manager
(or its affiliates or principals) may potentially or actually conﬂict with the interests of the Fund or the
Fund’s investors. Conﬂicts of interest may arise as a result of the principals of the Manager or other
investment funds managed by the Manager having existing investments in Portfolio Companies, as
well as other investments both public and private. Additionally, one or more of the principals of the
Manager may serve one or more Portfolio Companies on its board of directors or in a separate advisory
or consulting capacity, and instances may arise where the principal’s ﬁduciary duties to a Portfolio
Company or the principal’s advice or services might conflict with the interests of the Fund or the
Fund’s investors. By acquiring an Interest, the investor will be deemed to have acknowledged the
existence of any such actual or potential conﬂicts of interest and to have waived any claim with respect
to any liability arising from the existence of any such conﬂicts of interest.

((nwzmsa } 20

Lack of Control. Subject to the implementation of the investment limitations described in the Fund
Agreement, the Manager has complete discretion in managing the Fund’s portfolio. Investors will not
make or participate in decisions with respect to the management, disposition or other realization of any
investment made by the Fund or other decisions regarding the Fund’s business and affairs.

Leverage. To the extent a Portfolio Company has a leveraged capital structure or borrows or enters
into other ﬁnancing transactions requiring periodic payments, the Fund’s investment in the Portfolio
Company will be subject to increased exposure to adverse economic factors such as a significant rise
in interest rates, a severe downturn in the economy or deterioration in the condition of such company
or its industry. If such a Portfolio Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet principal
and interest payments on its indebtedness, the Value of any equity investment by the Fund in such
company could be significantly reduced or even eliminated.

Potential Liabilities. In connection with its investments, the Fund may negotiate the right to appoint
one of the principals of the Manager or its affiliate as a member of a Portfolio Company’s board of
directors. Membership on the board of directors of a Portfolio Company can result in the Fund or the
individual director being named as a defendant in litigation. The Fund may also participate in such a
Portfolio Company’s financing at valuations lower than the Valuations in preceding rounds of
financing. Disputes arising out of such downiround financings may result in the Fund, the Manager
or its members being named as defendants. A Portfolio Company may have insurance to protect
directors and officers, but any such insurance may be inadequate. Or, a Portfolio Company may have
no insurance to protect directors and officers. The Fund will indemnify the Manager and its principals,
among others, for liabilities incurred in connection with operations of the Fund, including liabilities
arising from such lawsuits. Such indemnification obligations and other liabilities could be substantial.

Market Lock-Up Provisions. If a Portfolio Company engages in a public offering, the securities held
by the Fund may continue to be subject to “lock up" provisions that may restrict the Fund’s ability to
trade or sell such investments on the public market for extended periods of time during which such
securities may experience substantial changes in value. As such, even where a Fund’s investment has
become publicly traded, there is no guarantee the Fund will be able to exit from the investment on the
terms initially offered to the public.

Limited Portfolio Diversiﬁcation. As is typical of venture capital funds, the Portfolio Company
holdings of the Fund will not be broadly diversified. A downturn of the economy or in the business of
the Portfolio Company could impact the aggregate retums delivered to investors by the Fund.

Manager Compensation. The amount of the management fee paid by the Fund to the Manager was
set by the Manager without negotiations with any third party. It is possible that other investment
advisers would perform the same services with respect to the Fund for less compensation than the
Manager will receive from the Fund.

Failure to Make Capital Contributions. If a Fund investor fails to satisfy when due installments of
its capital commitment to the Fund, and the contributions made by nonidefaulting investors in the Fund
and any borrowings by the Fund are inadequate to cover the defaulted amount, the Fund may be unable

((nwzmsm 21

to pay its obligations when due. As a result, the Fund may be subjected to significant penalties that
could materially and adversely affect the returns to its investors. If Fund investors default on their
capital commitment obligations to the Fund, such investors may be subject to various remedies as
provided in the Fund Agreement.

Withholding and Other Taxes. The Manager intends to structure the Fund’s investments in a manner
that is intended to achieve the Fund’s investment objectives and, notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, there can be no assurance that the structure of any investment will be tax efficient
for any particular Fund investor or that any particular tax result will be achieved. In addition, tax
reporting requirements may be imposed on Fund investors under the laws of the jurisdictions in which
such investors are liable for taxation or in which the Fund makes portfolio investments. Investors
should consult their own professional advisors with respect to the tax consequences of an investment
in the Fund under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the investors are liable for taxation.
Furthermore, the Fund’s returns in respect of its investments may be reduced by withholding or other
taxes imposed by jurisdictions in which a Portfolio Company is organized.

Limited Operating History. The Fund is a newly established limited liability company with no
operating history. The Fund’s investment program should be evaluated on the basis that there can be
no assurance that the Manager’s assessment of the prospects ofinvcstments will prove accurate or that
the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Past performance of the principals of the Manager is
not necessarily indicative of future results.

Diverse Investors. Investors in the Fund may have conflicting investment, tax, and other interests
with respect to their investments in the Fund. The conflicting interests of individual Fund investors
may relate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of investments made by the Fund, the
structuring or the acquisition of Fund investments and the timing of disposition of such investments.
As a consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with decisions made by the Manager
with respect to the nature or structuring of investments that may be more beneficial for some Fund
investors than for others, particularly with respect to investors’ individual tax situations. In selecting
and structuring investments appropriate for the Fund, the Manager will consider the investment and
tax objective of the Fund and its investors as a whole, not the investment, tax or other objective of any
particular individual Fund investor.

Risk of Dilution. Investors subscribing for interests in the Fund at closings other than the Fund’s
initial closing will participate in theneexisting investments of the Fund, diluting the interests of then,
existing investors therein. Although such investors will generally contribute their pro rata share of
prior capital contributions previously drawn down by the Fund, there can be no assurance that such
payment will reflect the fair value of the Fund’s existing investments at the time such additional
investors subscribe for such interests.

Foreign Investments. The Fund may hold investments in U.S. companies that may have operations
primarily outside of the U.S. Any investment by U.S. companies in a foreign country involves risks
not found in the U.S. domestic securities market, including the following: the risk of economic and

(autumn } 22

financial instability in the foreign country, which in some cases may include a collapse in credit
markets, stock prices, currencies and/or consumer spending; the risk of adverse social and political
developments, including nationalization, confiscation without fair compensation, political and social
instability and war; the risk that the foreign country may impose restrictions on the repatriation of
investment income or capital or on the ability of foreign persons to invest in certain types of companies,
assets or securities; risks related to the possible lack of availability of sufficient financial information
as a result of accounting, auditing, and financial disclosure standards that differ, in some cases
significantly, from those in the United States; risks related to foreign laws and legal systems, which
are likely to differ from those of the United States, including in particular the laws with respect to the
rights of investors which may not be as comprehensive or well developed as those in the United States
and the procedures for the judicial or other enforcement of such rights which may not be as effective
as in the United States; risks related to the fact that some investments may be denominated in foreign
currencies and, therefore, will be subject to ﬂuctuations in exchange rates; and risks related to
applicable tax laws and regulations and tax treaties, which are likely to vary from country to country
and may be less well developed than those in the United States, possibly resulting in retroactive
taxation so that the Fund could become subject to an unanticipated local tax liability.

Foreign Exchange Risks. Contributions to the Fund and distributions from the Fund will be
denominated in US. dollars. Investments may be denominated in Us. dollars or other foreign
currencies. As a result, the profits or losses of the Fund on any investment, as measured in US. dollars,
may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and exchange control regulations as well
as by the success of the investment itself. In addition, the Fund may incur costs in connection with
conversions between various currencies. Neither the Fund nor the Manager intends to seek to reduce
currency risks through “hedging" or other methods.

Tax Considerations. The Fund’s income and gain for each taxable year will be allocated to, and
includible in, each Fund investor’s taxable income whether or not cash or other property is actually
distributed. Although the Fund may make distributions, Fund investors should have alternative sources
from which to pay US. federal income tax liability.

Taxes and Economics May Not Match During a Calendar Year. The income tax effects of the
Fund’s transactions to investors may differ from the economic consequences of those transactions
during a calendar year.

There is the Possibility of a Tax Audit. The Fund’s tax returns might be audited by a taxing authority.
An audit could result in adjustments to the Fund’s tax returns. If an audit results in an adjustment,
investors may be required to file amended returns and to pay additional taxes plus interest. The Fund
may take positions with respect to certain tax issues that depend on legal conclusions not yet addressed
by the courts. Should any such positions be successfully challenged by the Us. Intemal Revenue
Service, investors might be found to have a different tax liability for that year than that reported on
their US. federal income tax returns. In addition, an audit of the Fund’s U.S. federal income tax
information retum may result in adjustments to the tax consequences initially reported by the Fund and
may affect items not related to investors’ investment in the Fund. If auditirelated adjustments result

(omnzmsm Z3

in an increase in an investor’s US. federal income tax liability for any year, the investor may also be
liable for interest and penalties with respect to the amount of underpayment. The legal and accounting
costs incurred in connection with any audit ofthe Fund’s tax return will be borne by the Fund.

No Distributions with Respect to Tax. The Fund is not required distribute cash to enable investors
to pay federal and state income taxes arising from the ownership of an Interest during a taxable year.
A Fund investor may be liable for federal and state income taxes on income related to its ownership of
an Interest, even though the investor has received no distributions from the Fund.

Conﬁdential Information. The Fund Agreement will contain confidentiality provisions intended to
protect proprietary and other information relating to the Fund and the Portfolio Companies. To the
extent that such information is publicly disclosed, competitors of the Fund and/or competitors of the
Portfolio Companies, and others, may benefit from such information, thereby adversely affecting the
Fund, the Portfolio Companies, the Manager and the economic interests ofthe Fund’s investors.

The foregoing risks do not purport to be a complete explanation of all the risks involved in acquiring
an Interest in the Fund. When considering whether to subscribe for an Interest, prospective investors
are urged to read the Fund’s entire Fund Agreement and consult with their legal, tax and other
professional advisors before making a determination whether to invest in the Fund.

IX. CERTAIN UNITED ATES FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The following discussion summarizes certain United States federal tax considerations generally
applicable to persons considering an investment in the Fund. The discussion does not address all tax
considerations that may be relevant to specific investors in light of their particular circumstances. No
other state, local or foreign tax considerations are addressed. All persons considering an investment
in the Fund are urged to consult with their own tax advisors as to the specific United States federal,
local and foreign tax consequences of such an investment.

In General. Except where specifically addressing considerations applicable to taxiexempt or foreign
investors, the discussion assumes that the Fund investor is a United States citizen or resident individual,
a domestic corporation that is not taxiexempt, or a foreign person whose Fund interest is used or held
for use in the conduct ofa United States trade or business. The discussion is based upon existing law
as contained in United States federal statutes, regulations, administrative rulings and judicial decisions
on the date of the this disclosure. Future changes to the law may, on either a prospective or retroactive
basis, give rise to materially different tax considerations. Finally, no rulings have been or will be
requested from the United States federal tax authorities as to any matter and there can be no assurance
that such authorities will not successfully assert a position contrary to one or more of the legal
conclusions discussed herein.

Effect of Partnership Status. The Fund will be treated as a partnership, and not as an association
taxable as a corporation, for United States federal income tax purposes. As such, the Fund will not be
subject to federal income tax. Instead, each Fund investor will be required to report on such investor’s

((nwzmsa } 24

federal income tax return its allocated share of the Fund’s items of income, gain, loss and deduction
substantially as if such investor had recognized the items directly. Accordingly, a Fund investor
generally will be required to pay tax on its share of the Fund’s net income or gain (and, in the case of
capital gain, will be entitled to the beneﬁts of reduced capital gain rates) in the year recognized without
regard to whether the Fund makes a corresponding cash distribution. Except as described in the
following paragraph, distributions (as opposed to allocations of taxable income or gain) received by a
Fund investor from the Fund generally will not be subject to tax, but a Fund investor selling appreciated
securities distributed to it by the Fund generally will be required to include in income for federal
income tax purposes all of the appreciation in the value of such securities, including any such
appreciation that accrued while the securities were held by the Fund.

It is expected that the Fund will qualify as an “investment partnership” Within the meaning of Section
731(c) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If the Fund
does not so qualify, an investor in the Fund that receives a distribution of marketable securities from
the Fund may be required to recognize taxable gain to the extent that the fair market value of the
distributed securities exceeds the investor’s tax basis in its Fund interest.

As the tax matters partner of the Fund, the Manager will have the right to control any audit or
investigation of the Fund by the Internal Revenue Service and all subsequent administrative and
judicial proceedings arising out of such audit. The Manager will also have the authority under the
Fund Agreement to make, or decline to make, all applicable tax elections on behalf of the Fund.

Trade or Business Status. The Fund generally intends to take the position for federal income tax
purposes that its operations and activities constitute an investment activity rather than the active
conduct of a trade or business. One consequence of this position is that noncapitalized investment
expenses incurred by the Fund in carrying on its activities generally will be treated by investors in the
Fund who are individuals as “miscellaneous itemized deductions” and may not be available (or may
be only partially available) to offset such investors’ taxable income from the Fund or other sources.

Passive Activity Loss Rules. A Fund investor that is subject to the “passive activity loss mles” of the
Code generally will not be permitted to offset against investor’s share of the Fund’s income and gain
any losses or other deductions generated by the investor’s investments in “passive activities” (until the
investor’s interests in such passive activities are disposed of). The activity of “trading personal
property for the account of owners of interests in the activity" does not give rise to passive activity
income or loss. Accordingly, a Fund investor’s ability to reduce its income for federal income tax
purposes by the investor’s share ofthe Fund’s losses and deductions attributable to purchases and sales
of Portfolio Company securities generally should not be limited by the passive activity loss rules
(although such losses and deductions may be subject to other limitations, including restrictions on the
use of miscellaneous itemized deductions and capital losses).

Transfer of a Fund Interest. The sale or exchange of a Fund interest by an investor generally would
result in the recognition of capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the investor’s tax basis
in the Fund interest and the amount of consideration received, although a portion of such gain or loss

((uwzmsa } 25

may be recharacterized as ordinary income or loss to the extent attributable to the investor’s indirect
share of certain assets of the Fund (including, without limitation, market discount bonds, shortiterm
debt obligations, and stock in certain foreign corporations) described in Section 751(c) of the Code.

50 Percent Capital Gain Exclusion for Qualiﬁed Small Business Investments. In general,
noncorporate investors that, directly or via a passithrough entity such as the Fund, hold qualiﬁed “small
business stock" for more than 5 years are permitted to exclude from taxable income 50 percent of any
gain subsequently recognized upon a sale or exchange of such stock (60 percent for qualified business
entity stock). For each noncorporate investor, the amount of gain eligible for the 50 percent exclusion
generally is limited to the greater of: (i) 10 times the investor’s basis in the stock issued by such
corporation and disposed of by such taxpayer during the taxable year or (ii) an aggregate of$10 million
($5,000,000 for married taxpayers filing separately) with regard to stock in the issuing corporation.
The remaining 50 percent of any qualifying gain is subject to tax at a rate of 28 percent, resulting in an
effective tax rate of 14 percent on the entire gain. Seven percent of the 50 percent exclusion is treated
as a preference item (and thus added back to the 28% tax bracket) for federal alternative minimum tax
purposes. Accordingly, subject to the limitations described above, the total amount of qualified gain
recognized by an individual who is subject to alternative minimum tax would be taxable at an effective
maximum rate of 14.98 percent, which is less than the current maximum tax rate on long term capital
gains of 23.8 percent.

To be treated as small business stock eligible for the 50 percent exclusion, stock must have been
acquired at original issue from a qualified small business corporation. In general, a qualified small
business corporation is a domestic “C" corporation that, at all times on and after August 10, 1993 and
before the stock in question is issued and immediately after issuing the stock in question, has $50
million or less in gross assets and satisfies certain other requirements. Because several of these
requirements must continue to be satisfied after the issuance of qualified stock, it is possible that the
stock may cease to qualify as small business stock due to events occurring after the issue date.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any stock acquired directly or indirectly by the Fund would
qualify for the 50 percent exclusion, even if such stock qualifies as small business stock at the time of
issuance.

Rollover for Qualified Small Business Stock. Under Section 1045 of the Code, if a noncorporate
taxpayer (i) realizes gain on a sale of qualified small business stock (as defined above) that has been
held by the taxpayer for more than six months, and (ii) within 60 days after such sale, purchases new
qualified small business stock, the taxpayer generally is required to recognize (and pay tax on) such
gain only to the extent that the net sale proceeds from the original stock exceed the cost of the newly
purchased stock. Any remaining gain is carried over to the newly purchased stock and may be
recognized (and taxable) upon a subsequent disposition of such stock. Section 1045 generally operates
on a flowithrough basis with respect to purchases and sales of qualified small business stock by entities
treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes such as the Fund. Thus, noncorporate Fund
investors may be entitled to Section 1045 rollover benefits when the Fund sells and purchases
securities. Nevertheless, stock may cease to qualify as qualified small business stock due to
circumstances beyond the control of the Fund. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any

(0011720452 } 26

noncorporate Fund investor would be entitled to the benefits of Section 1045 with respect to any
specific purchases and sales of stock by the Fund.

Tax-Exempt Investors. It is anticipated that the Fund’s income will consist principally, if not
exclusively, of dividends and interest as well as gains from the disposition of capital assets or other
property not held for sale in the ordinary course of business. However, the Manager will be under no
obligation to avoid causing the Fund to recognize income or gains that qualify as “unrelated business
taxable income” (“UBTI”) within the meaning of Sections 5117514 of the Code.

Foreign Investors. For purposes of the remainder of this discussion, the term “Foreign Investor”
generally refers to a person, not otherwise carrying on a trade or business in the United States, that is
a nonresident alien individual, a corporation or partnership organized under the laws of a foreign
country, a trust or estate not subject to United States taxation on its worldwide income, or an entity
that is disregarded for purposes of US. tax law and owned by a foreign person. As discussed above
under the section titled “Trade or Business Status,” the Fund generally intends to take the position for
federal income tax purposes that it is not engaged in the conduct of a trade or business. If this position
is upheld, Foreign Investors generally will not, solely as a result of investment in the Fund, be: (i)
considered to be engaged in a United States trade or business, (ii) required to file United States federal
income tax returns, or (iii) subject to United States federal income tax on gain from the sale of capital
assets held by them directly or through their interests in the Fund. However, the Fund would be
required to withhold tax at a 30 percent rate from the gross amount of United States source income
allocated to a Foreign Investor to the extent such income consists of dividends or certain types of
interest or other passive income. A Foreign Investor that is eligible for a reduced rate of United States
taxation pursuant to a tax treaty may obtain a refund from the Internal Revenue Service with respect
to its share of any tax withheld.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Foreign Investor’s share of the net gain recognized upon disposition
by the Fund of a United States real property interest would be treated for federal income tax purposes
as if it were effectively connected with a United States trade or business. For this purpose, the term
“United States real property interest” generally would include any interest in real property located in
the United States. These provisions have a “lookrthrough” rule that encompasses the stock of
companies in which at least half of the fair market value of their trade or business at any point during
the preceding 5 years comprises United States real property assets.1 In general, if Foreign Investors
were deemed to dispose of a United States real property interest under any of these niles, then the Fund
would be required to withhold tax at the highest marginal income tax rate from allocations to such
Foreign Investors of such net gain and each Foreign Investor would be required to report its share of
such gain on a United States federal income tax return. While it is not intended that the Fund will

' Classes of publicly traded stock (i.e., any class of stock that is regularly traded on an established
securities market) are only subject to this rule in the case of a foreign person who owns, directly or
indirectly, greater than 5 percent of such stock at any point during the 5 years preceding its disposition.

(000720452; 27

acquire or dispose of assets that qualify as United States real property interests, there can be no
assurance that Portfolio Company securities will not so qualify.

If the Fund were determined to be engaged in a trade or business, Foreign Investors generally would
be: (i) considered to be engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, (ii) required
to ﬁle United States federal income tax returns and pay United States federal income tax and (iii)
subject to United States federal income tax withholding with respect to that portion of their shares of
the Fund’s net income which is considered to be effectively connected with such trade or business. In
addition, Foreign Investors that are corporations may be subject to a 30 percent tax on their “dividend
equivalent amount” for purposes ofthc United States branch proﬁts tax, subject to possible reduction
pursuant to an international bilateral income tax treaty. Finally, Foreign Investors could be subject to
United States federal income tax with respect to any gain recognized upon a sale or exchange of their
interests in the Fund, depending on the assets the Fund holds at such time and the type of sale. Foreign
Investors may apply withheld taxes against the tax liability shown on their federal income tax returns
and refunds may be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service for any excess tax withheld.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act,
payments made to foreign entities and foreign financial institutions after July 1, 2014 will be subject
to a thirty percent (30%) U.S. withholding tax unless the foreign entity or foreign financial institution
has complied with reporting and disclosure requirements regarding “United States persons” (within the
meaning of Section 7701 of the Code) that hold a financial account, either directly or indirectly, with
such foreign entities or foreign financial institutions.

FOREIGN INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT WITH THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS TO
DECIDE WHICH UNITED STATES TAX FORMS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED TO THE FUND
UPON PURCHASING AN INTEREST THEREIN.

Federal Estate Tax Considerations for Foreign Investors. The applicability of United States federal
estate tax to a Fund interest owned at the time of death by a Foreign Investor who is an individual is
uncertain under current law. Accordingly, a Foreign Investor who is an individual may wish to
consider holding his or her interest in the Fund through a noniU.S. corporation.
